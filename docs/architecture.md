# MilesForHope Architecture Documentation

## Overview
MilesForHope is a full-stack charity run management system built with Next.js and Laravel. The application provides features for user registration, donation management, and administrative controls.

## Core Features

### User Registration System
The registration system is designed to provide a seamless experience while ensuring data accuracy and security. Users begin their registration through a multi-step form that collects essential information such as personal details, contact information, and event preferences. The system implements real-time validation to ensure data integrity, checking for valid email formats, phone numbers, and required fields.

Upon submission, the system automatically generates a unique registration token and sends a verification email to the user. This email contains a secure link that the user must click to confirm their registration. The system maintains different registration states (pending, confirmed, cancelled) and automatically updates the user's status based on their actions. Throughout this process, users receive timely email notifications about their registration status, upcoming events, and important deadlines.

### Donation Management
The donation system is built around Stripe's secure payment infrastructure, providing a reliable and secure way to process donations. When a user initiates a donation, the system creates a secure checkout session through Stripe, supporting various payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets. The system handles both one-time and recurring donations, with the ability to set up automated monthly contributions.

Each donation is tracked with a unique transaction ID and generates an automated receipt that includes all necessary information. The system maintains a comprehensive audit trail of all transactions, including payment status, payment history, and communication records.

### Admin Dashboard
The admin dashboard serves as the central control center for managing the entire charity run operation. Administrators can access the dashboard after completing a secure two-factor authentication process. The dashboard provides real-time insights into registration numbers, donation totals, and event progress.

Administrators have granular control over user registrations, with the ability to review, approve, or reject applications. They can manage user profiles, update information, and handle special requests. The donation management interface allows administrators to track all financial transactions, process refunds, and generate financial reports. The system maintains detailed audit logs of all administrative actions, ensuring accountability and transparency.

### Event Management
The event management system provides comprehensive tools for organizing and executing charity runs. Administrators can create and configure events with detailed information about routes, start times, and participant requirements.

The route management feature allows administrators to define and map out the course, including start and finish lines, water stations, and medical checkpoints. The system integrates with timing systems to track participant progress and generate accurate results. Real-time analytics provide insights into participant distribution, completion rates, and potential bottlenecks.

### Communication System
The communication system is built around a robust email infrastructure that ensures reliable delivery of important information to all stakeholders. The system maintains a comprehensive library of email templates for various scenarios, including registration confirmations, donation receipts, event reminders, and important announcements. Each template is customizable and can be personalized with user-specific information.

The email system is event-driven, automatically triggering communications based on specific actions in the system. For example, when a user completes their registration, they receive a confirmation email with their registration details and next steps. Similarly, after a successful donation, donors receive an automated receipt email with their transaction information. The system also handles bulk communications for important announcements, with features to track delivery status and manage unsubscribe requests.

### Reporting and Analytics
The system provides real-time insights into the charity run's performance through various dashboards and data displays. Financial data is tracked and displayed through the admin interface, showing current totals for registration fees, donations, and sponsorships. The interface provides a clear breakdown of expenses, helping administrators monitor resource allocation.

User analytics are displayed through interactive dashboards that show participant behavior, registration patterns, and donation trends. The system tracks and displays conversion rates at various stages of the registration and donation processes, helping identify areas for improvement. The analytics interface provides visual representations of key metrics, making it easy to understand the current state of the charity run.

### Security Features
Security is implemented at every level of the application. The authentication system uses industry-standard practices, including secure password hashing, session management, and protection against common attacks. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security for administrative access, requiring both a password and a time-based one-time code.

Data protection measures include encryption of sensitive information, secure storage of payment details, and regular security audits. The system implements strict access controls, ensuring that users can only access information relevant to their role.
